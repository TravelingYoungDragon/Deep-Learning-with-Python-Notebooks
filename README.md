# Deep-Learning-with-Python-Notebooks
This repository contains my Jupyter notebooks implementation about the book [Deep Learning with Python (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff).

这个仓库是我学习《Deep Learning with Python》(第二版，François Chollet 著) 时跟着书上写的  Jupyter notebooks，主要是代码实例以及我的一些思考、笔记。

你可以在这个网址在线阅读这本书的正版原文(英文)：[https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python)。这本书的作者也给出了一套 Jupyter notebooks：[https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)。

Notice: Instead of using Keras with a backend as what in the book, `tensorflow.keras` (with tf 2.0+) was taken in this notebooks.
